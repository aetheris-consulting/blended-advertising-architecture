# START HERE – Blended Advertising Architecture

This repository defines a **governance-first systems architecture** for how AI, humans, and organizations interact in commercial and decision-making environments.

It is not a product or implementation — it is a **reference architecture** designed to support:

- Human-in-the-loop AI systems  
- Policy-first decision workflows  
- Auditable AI actions  
- Safe monetization models  
- Enterprise and regulated environments  

---

## Reading Order

If you are new to this architecture, review the documents in the following order:

### 1. Core Systems Grammar  
**`universal_systems_grammar_primitives.md`**  
Defines the foundational primitives:

- Everything is a dataset  
- Everything is a file (artifact)  
- Everything is an organization  
- Everything is a workflow  
- Compliance is nested  
- Interactions are nested  
- Six-loci explainability model  

This is the conceptual backbone of the system.

---

### 2. Connector & Integration Model  
**`commerce_connector_layer.md`**  
Explains how external vendors, platforms, and services integrate safely via:

- Governed boundaries  
- Capability-scoped connectors  
- Policy-gated data access  
- No autonomous purchasing  

---

### 3. Trust & Safety Guardrails  
**`trust_and_safety_commerce.md`**  
Details the safety principles:

- No AI financial authority  
- Human approval requirements  
- Influence disclosure  
- Audit logging  
- Anti-steering protections  

---

### 4. Enterprise Monetization Architecture  
**`enterprise_monetization_architecture.md`**  
Explains how monetization works without violating:

- Compliance  
- Trust  
- Procurement rules  
- User autonomy  

---

## Design Guarantees

This architecture enforces:

- Humans remain the final authority  
- AI never commits money or contracts  
- Policies always outrank monetization  
- Every decision produces an audit artifact  
- Influence is transparent, not hidden  

---

## What “Blended” Means

“Blended” does **not** mean intrusive advertising.

It means:

- Commercial information appears only when relevant  
- Visibility is bounded by policy and user intent  
- Influence is disclosed  
- Value is prioritized over interruption  

---

## Status

This repository is a **reference architecture** for:

- AI governance  
- Agentic system safety  
- Enterprise AI adoption  
- Ethical monetization models  

It is intentionally implementation-agnostic.
