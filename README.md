# Blended Advertising Architecture (BAA)

Blended Advertising Architecture (BAA) is a governance-first systems framework for how AI, organizations, and individuals interact in commercial and decision-making environments.

Rather than treating advertising as interruption-based “ad tech,” BAA reframes monetization as **policy-constrained visibility** within trusted workflows.

The architecture ensures:

- AI assists but never autonomously spends, negotiates, or commits resources  
- Humans remain the final authority for financial and operational decisions  
- All actions are auditable, explainable, and policy-aligned  
- Commercial influence is transparent, not hidden  
- Compliance and safety always outrank monetization

## Core Principles

- Everything is a **data set**  
- Everything is a **file** (versioned artifact)  
- Everything is an **organization**  
- Everything is a **workflow**  
- Compliance is **nested**  
- Organizational interactions are **nested**  

To support trust and explainability, the system uses a **six-loci perspective model**:

### Internal loci  
1) Self → Self (goal & budget coherence)  
2) Self within systems of self (roles & authority)  
3) Self within external systems (policies & constraints)  

### External loci  
4) Self → Others (impact on others)  
5) Others → Self (influence on the user)  
6) Others ↔ Others (system-level dynamics)

## What “Blended” Means

“Blended” does not mean intrusive ads.

It means:

- Commercial information appears **only when relevant**
- Visibility is bounded by policy and user intent
- Influence is disclosed, not hidden
- Value is prioritized over interruption

This makes the system suitable for:

- Enterprise procurement  
- Personal AI companions  
- Regulated environments  
- AI-assisted commerce  
- Government & compliance-heavy workflows

## Design Guarantees

- No autonomous AI purchasing  
- No hidden sponsorship  
- No policy overrides for money  
- No untraceable decisions  
- No unapproved financial actions  

Every meaningful action produces an **audit artifact**.

## Status

This repository defines a **reference architecture**, not a product.

Its purpose is to provide a reusable grammar for:

- AI governance  
- Human-in-the-loop systems  
- Safe agentic design  
- Enterprise AI adoption  
- Ethical monetization models
